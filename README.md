# Leroy Merlin Technology Culture

Hello and welcome! This is home for Leroy Merlin Russia technology culture. All materials see in the `content` folder.

## What is the purpose

The main reason for this site is to have all common technical agreements in a written form in the central place [tech.leroymerlin.ru](https://tech.leroymerlin.ru/).

## Signing process

To emphasize agreement and active involvement in the process, we came up with a signature process.

**At the bottom of this page, you find the list of supporters of values.
All signatories participated in the maintenance of values and fully agree with all listed points.**

```
Open the pull request and add your name only if you share the values described on the portal.
```

## Contributing

All content crafted manually by the group of enthusiasts.
You can find `.md` files in the `content` folder.
The contribution is welcomed, let's build, support, and describe the best engineering culture.

Feel free to open PR or Issue in this repo. 
There is no special described process of updating the values or other content.
Therefore, the form of change is open and free. 
Our goal is to describe and align the culture with all colleagues.

In case of any questions, contact with Dmitrii Sugrobov.

## Running the website locally

The following will give you a project that is set up and ready to use (don't forget to use `--recurse-submodules` or you won't pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site). The `hugo server` command builds and serves the site. If you just want to build the site, run `hugo` instead.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/adeo/lmru--tech
cd lmru--tech
hugo server
```
