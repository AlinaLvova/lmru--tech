We don't use a mono stack approach. Our wide stack gives us the possibility to use the best tools for each use case, helps to model tech future, to develop skills and avoid tech and vendor lock-in.

#### Here are the main influences to select the right technologies:

* Current and future capability to develop and support component in terms of workforce
* Maturity of a technology
* Types of components (business logic, system, and middle-level software)
* Architecture patterns (loose coupling, monolithic)
* Development patterns (frameworks, code transparency, etc.)
* Specific of using (type of load, sensitivity of data, etc.)
* Licensing policy

### Technology table
To make the process of choosing technology more clear and simple we going to have a table, where we have an area (DB, Frontend, backend, etc.), use cases like CRUD API, BFF, Process orchestration and so on. For each use case, we have the technology (programming language, framework, product ) and our attitude to this. Attitude shows: is it the `best choice`, on `research` or on the `trial stage`. We have the `hold` section where located unaccepted or ancient technologies. Our attitude to each technology has an explanation of why.

### Technology stack life cycle
We have the practice to update the technology table. During Technology Committee we decide which technology needs to start research or try in production systems. We confirm change technologies for the `best choice` section.
