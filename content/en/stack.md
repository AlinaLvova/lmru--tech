We don't use a mono stack approach.
Our wide stack gives us the possibility to use the best tools for each use case, helps to model tech future,
to develop skills and avoid tech and vendor lock-in.

#### Here are the main influences to select the right technologies:
* Current and future capability to develop and support component in terms of workforce
* Maturity of a technology
* Way of use (business logic, system, and middle-level software)
* Specific of using (type of load, sensitivity of data, etc.)
* Licensing policy

### Technology Committee
The committee is a community of enterprise architects, technical architects and technical leaders of development teams and IT infrastructure. The main goal of the committee is the selection and recommendations on the use of technologies in Leroy Merlin Russia and increasing the efficiency of use of company resources. Technologies are understood as programming languages, frameworks and libraries, software tools and approaches in the context of specific usage scenarios.

### How to start to use new technology 
* Adoption of technology for research with an understanding of the resources and timing of the process. To make this decision, it is required to have more than 40% positively voted participants.
* Move technology from the research phase to the `trial` section. To make this decision, it is required to have more than 50% positively voted participants.
* Move technology from the phase of `trial` use to the `best choice` section. To make this decision, it is required to have more than 80% positively voted participants.
* Move technology from the `best choice` section to `on hold`. To make this decision, all existing software components must be analyzed for refactoring and fixing technical debt and the positive decision of more than 90% of the meeting participants.
* Other decisions on changing the composition of the participants and the rules of the Committee are made with a positive decision by more than 50% of the participants.

<abbr data-toggle="tooltip" title="Chief Technology Officer">CTO</abbr>, <abbr data-toggle="tooltip" title="Chief Information Officer">CIO</abbr>, and <abbr data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lead Enterprice Architect">LEA</abbr> have the right to veto all decisions made. All movements in the Table are logged in decision records table with the dates and causes.

### Technology table
Here is the second version of the way of displaying of a tech stack.
Previously we had Technology Radar, however, this could not be used.

To make the process of choosing technology more clear and simple we going to have a table,
where we have an <abbr data-toggle="tooltip" title="DB, Frontend, backend, etc">area</abbr>
and <abbr data-toggle="tooltip" title="CRUD API, BFF, Process orchestration and so on">use cases</abbr>.
For each use case, we have the <abbr data-toggle="tooltip" title="programming language, framework, product">technology</abbr>
and our attitude to this. Attitude shows: is it the `best choice`, on `research` or on the `trial stage`.
We have the `hold` section where located unaccepted or ancient technologies. Our attitude to each technology
has an explanation of why.

Technologies in each columns can work in production.
