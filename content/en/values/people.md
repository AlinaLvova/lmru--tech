### 1. Common goals are more important than individual.

* Pull issues from backlog rather than be pushed by someone. 
* It is good to share practices between teams. 
* We have mentors. We can ask anyone to be mentor. 

#### Practices & rituals: 
*[blocking code-review](../../glossary/#blocking-code-review)*, *[communities](../../glossary/#communities)*, *[onboarding check-list with a required mentor](../../glossary/#onboarding-check-list)*

### 2. We accept mistakes and learn from them.

* We must offer and test fast our ideas, even the craziest.
* We are not afraid to take the first step, fall into the dirt, rise, shake off, write a post mortem with clean hands, and go the other way. 
* Mistakes make us stronger only if we have post-mortem and avoid repetition. 
* Mistakes term do not include intentional violation of the rules or laziness. 

#### Practices & rituals:
