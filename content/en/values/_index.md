## Why whe need this

As you may know, engineering culture is present in every company, but not every company describes it in the written form.
The development of IT products is a complex process, with no possibility to create instructions for all occasions.
Therefore, IT companies Ð±building relationships on trust, resort to the practice of describing engineering values.
This helps to act in a consistent manner and, as a result, to develop reliable software faster. It also speeds up the onboarding of new hires and protects the common-sense position.

Engineering culture is our competitive advantage in the market.
