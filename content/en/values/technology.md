### 6. We build robust applications and infrastructure.

* We response accurately and correctly handle wrong inputs.
* Services provides <abbr data-toggle="tooltip" title="Service Level Objective is a goal that service provider wants to reach. Google it for details.">SLO</abbr> and controls them.
* We handle partial outages.
