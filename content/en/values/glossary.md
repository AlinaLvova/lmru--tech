## \#
### 30% rule
Each engineer may spend some part of his working time on R&D tasks or technical debt reduction.

## A
### Availability of the tools
We can take corporate notebooks wherever we want. All tools and environments are available on the internet or through VPN.

## B
### BORD
Once a year feedback session. Used also for yearly goals standing.

<hr />

## С
### Communities

<hr />

## D
### Daily Meeting
15-minute time-boxed event held each day for the team for the next 24 hours work planning. This optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily and forecasting upcoming work. [[scrum guide]](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-daily)

### DevOps
A friendship between developers and operations :) If seriously, I would recommend to read [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592) to understand what is it.

*[← back to value](../technology/#2-we-are-automate-everything-as-much-as-possible)*

### Did something ask for feedback
Short cycles and feedback loops – an ideal picture. The sooner you get the feedback, the faster you can fix the problem.

*[← back to value](../people/#4-we-give-and-request-constructive-feedback)*
<hr />

## E
### External Configuration
A changeable configuration of applications should be stored in the environment.

*[← back to value](../architecture/#2-we-use-modular-architecture)*
<hr />

## F
### Fail fast rule

*[← back to value](../people/#2-we-accept-mistakes-and-learn-from-them)*
<hr />

## H
### High Cohesion
High cohesion is when you have a class (or module) that does a well defined job. Low cohesion is when a class does a lot of jobs that don't have much in common. [[source]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10830135/what-is-high-cohesion-and-how-to-use-it-make-it)

*[← back to value](../architecture/#2-we-use-modular-architecture)*
<hr />

## I
### Internal Rotation
Want to change job — ask HR for options.

*[← back to value](../people/#5-your-job-is-safe-your-role-is-not)*
<hr />

## K
### KISS
Keep It Stupid Simple. Like Occam said, «[entities should not be multiplied without necessity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)». Adding new levels of abstraction must have a strong reason. Adding new data entities or solution components also must have strong reason. Simplification is a King and we welcome the approach to describe it as an architecture debt and rework the complex areas to make it simple. The decision is made at the level of a technical and solution architect, in controversial situations we made decisions on the [Architecture Committee](#solution-architect-review).

### Orchestration / Choreography
Microservices pattern for building of sequenses of execution (SAGAs). Short explanation [here](https://medium.com/ingeniouslysimple/choreography-vs-orchestration-a6f21cfaccae). Detailed [here](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html).

## P
### Planning
Special event for planning of the work to be performed. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire team. [[scrum guide]](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-planning)

*[← back to value](../people/#3-we-respect-colleagues-and-their-time)*

### Post Mortem

<hr />

## R
### Remote Ready
The organization modifies its process for meetings, reviews, and other collaboration to accommodate remote work. Remote-only employees have meetings that are built with them in mind.

Other points: 

* Meetings via videoconferencing by default
* Accessible, structured, and documented team meetings
* Document, document, document (aka, nothing is word-of-mouth or from memory)
* No hallway conversations (unless you document them)
* Planned together-time

### Required agenda in invitation
Each invitation to the meeting should have agenda and the meeting goal.

*[← back to value](../people/#3-we-respect-colleagues-and-their-time)*

### Retrospective
The Retro is the event giving an opportunity for the team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted next time. [[scrum guide]](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-retro)

### Revenue / Expenses ratio
An estimated amount of money earned by product or feature divided on spends on it.

## S
### Solution Architect Review
Also known as Architecture Committee. Enterprise & Solution architects meeting. Held by demand. Leader – CTO.

Main tasks: 

* solution architecture problem solving
* escalation place for architecture gaps / technical debt grow
* unblocking issues with technical debt
* solution architecture consulting
